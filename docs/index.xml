      <description>“The texts labeled ‘history’ tell one story. If anyone bothers to ask, we can tell another.”
This Ks’ou, who should have been his enemy, said these words as she shifted her weight on the edge of the vault of their damaged ship, then pushed one of the last bottles of water in his direction. It rolled to him easily. He picked it up and tried to suppress the hint of disgust as he drank, but he could not help the display, obvious as a Human grimace.</description>

      <description>“Flesh describes an alien entity, a more or less expendable figure…
its most poignant determination is the extent to which such a body cannot prevent or ward off another&amp;rsquo;s touch.

      <description>Previous Chapter
NeVarr&amp;ndash;and by default, James&amp;ndash;were standing in front of the tank. The edges on the wide afro of the human glowing slightly aquamarine in its light. The Ks&amp;rsquo;ou formed the humans lips and sent the signals to vibrate the throat: it was a quiet mumble, as they shook a flaky substance onto the open top of the water. A couple of snails were stuck to the side of the tank; the fish that remained from the last fiasco were maneuvering calmly throughout the seagrass that NeVarr had recently planted.</description>
