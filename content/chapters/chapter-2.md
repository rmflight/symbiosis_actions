[Previous Chapter]({{<ref "chapter-1.md" >}})

NeVarr--and by default, James--were standing in front of the tank. The edges on the wide afro of the human glowing slightly aquamarine in its light. The Ks'ou formed the humans lips and sent the signals to vibrate the throat: it was a quiet mumble, as they shook a flaky substance onto the open top of the water. A couple of snails were stuck to the side of the tank; the fish that remained from the last fiasco were maneuvering calmly throughout the seagrass that NeVarr had recently planted.  

They had had cuttlefish some time ago before both Aurana and Ana finally convinced NeVarr to give up once the latest one had died. He mourned a little longer than was appropriate; Aurana reminded him sharply that they weren’t sentient as Ks’ou were. Ana invoked a gentleness that humans were so good at: she knew that the resemblance of Ks’ou to cuttlefish was close, and reminded him that cuttlefish were limited with their eight arms and inability to speak back despite NeVarr’s numerous attempts to detach from his human and crawl into the tank with them and make contact. 

NeVarr refused to believe it at first. “If it’s true they aren’t sentient, how can they have eyes? WE Ks’ou don’t even have eyes. And yet they can’t communicate?”

“Having eyes and communicating sentiently are two different things.” 

They thought once he’d given up on cuttlefish-raising that he was done, but he diligently kept the tank thriving, with almost six or seven creatures—two fish, two snails, and some crustaceans—seeming to be swimming happily now that their cuttlefish predator was gone. 

So was the scene that Aurana, in Ana, walked in to as they returned from their recent KLF solo mission: NeVarr, in James, humming evenly, as though reciting a poem.

“They can’t hear you,” Aurana said mildly, locking the front door behind them. “And even when we’ve attempted to communicate via our natural tongue in water, all studies have pointed to no signs of conscience.”

NeVarr ignored her, continuing to speak rhythmically. After a moment, he stood and observed her, noting the blood in her sleeve and gesturing towards his own cheek to show that hers wasn’t quite clean. She dragged her human’s hand against it instinctively; NeVarr sighed, “Do you think it’s true? That we all began on the same planet, even humans? That every thing, in the entire universe, was once… of one kyôsta?”

“It’s an interesting theory. Unconfirmed and likely uncomfirmable. A creation story, as any other.”

NeVarr snorted rudely. “You don’t even care for your human’s creation story.”

“It doesn’t taste,” Aurana responded. Such was the Ks’ou way of interpreting the world, even this one largely devoid of water. 

“Our job as symbiotes is to taste any thing that has been robbed of us,” NeVarr said cooly. “Air thriving. The life of mind. Tasting.”

“You taste more than most Ks’ou,” Aurana said, grinning thinly, gazing past NeVarr to the kitchen, where a mess invariably await. “What will you do when we are back on kyôsta and you are no longer allowed to eat with a tongue?”

He nodded. “It’s the only thing that would convince me to stay on Earth.” Preemptively he held out a hand to stay her shocked expression, “Relax, relax. Obviously we have to leave when the war is over, and that includes leaving our humans, too. I’m just dreaming impossibility. Can I do that, at least?”

Aurana threw their bags on the couch, a gesture she knew would annoy NeVarr to no end, because the only mess he failed to recognize was the one he created in the kitchen.  She sat her human’s body down and illuminated the screen, but none of the images that passed sight interested her. It was a far cry than from when she first learned ‘sight,’ as with eyes, when all things were fascinating. Now it was dull; repetitive. 

NeVarr sat himself and his human, James, down next to them on the other side of the couch. They watched in silence for moments before she spoke.

“You’re dressed like a jackass clown. Are you going to DJ again tonight?”

She never looked at him, but could hear him, burning at the cheeks.

He made a small choking sound. “Please don’t tell Ana. Is she listening, now?” 

“She’s not listening to us,” Aurana said haughtily. “She’s in the archive.”

“You know about this? The club?”

“Ana tells me everything,” Aurana said calmly, tearing her human’s eyes away from the screen to give NeVarr a pointed look. “Unlike some Ks’ou present, I don’t need to take information from my human that she freely gives.”

“That was only in the beginning,” NeVarr said defensively. His eyes narrowed, as though challenging her. He even licked his lips slightly, his unconscious habit. “Besides…” he frowned, his eyebrows narrowing, “She doesn’t tell you everything.”

“Doesn’t she?”

NeVarr had a way of pushing his human’s expression into something unreadable, his eyes were wide and bright. “What’s my favorite food?”

She scoffed. “We’re Ks’ou. We’re not supposed to have a single favorite food.”

“Well, I do. And Ana knows it.” He pushed his human lips into a thin, triumphant line. “Your human doesn’t tell you everything.” He’d said this with an unnecessary finality, returning to the moving light on the screens, but she could tell he wasn’t paying attention.

After some time, NeVarr continued, as though excusing himself, “I’ve limited my club time because of Ana. I’m on call for emergencies only. Only because of what happened…”

“I know what happened,” Aurana snapped. She didn’t, in fact, but she was testing him. He didn’t fall for it. 

“Kwa. Aurana. Did you know…” he hesitated. “The KLF has charged me. Me. I’m not supposed to inform you, my Sub Aspirant, about it.”

Aurana glanced at him, but his gaze was not directly back at her. Instead, he looked towards the table, where a simple white sheet lay. 

“I’ve only partially deciphered it. But it… I know, already, that it’s beyond anything I’ve ever done. I’m not ready. I can’t do it alone.”

Aurana noted his worry, and, as was typical, did not let emotion overcome her visage. Humans felt much; Ks’ou did, too. It could be embraced without being indulged. “You’ll be fine, NeVarr. This is good news. They want to promote you.”

NeVarr scoffed. “Or kill me.” 

She ignored him, “Let’s decipher it completely, together, and then I can help you plan what to do.” He didn’t look fully convinced so she sighed and said, “Remember the Protocols.”

“You and these Protocols.”

“They’re useful. I say them to myself when I have trouble sleeping.”

“There’s something very wrong with you,” he said, arching the eyebrows of his human, but sighed and said, “Just the first two, okay?”

Together, they repeated: “Protocol 1. Subset 1. We aim to dismantle the Ks'ou Nation, fully and without exception.
Protocol 1. Subset 2. We aim to re-establish Ks'ou as a peaceful presence in the universe.”

There were more, many more. And Protocol Sifr, of course, but that one was so burned into their founds, so foundational, so utterly necessary to everything the KLF aimed to do, that they never found it necessary to say aloud.

Protocols 1.1. and 1.2 usually sufficed. To remind them what set them apart. To remind them the levity of what they needed to shift. She convinced NeVarr to repeat Protocols 1.1 and 1.2 three times over. The third, NeVarr actually smiled and said, “You’re right. That did make me feel better. So many Ks’ou have failed to succeed at Protocol 1.2. We’re all really bad at it. Why should I expect to do any better?”

--

The greatest true stories they knew—and Aurana had the greatest repository of stories in the known universe—began with births and deaths. Which is why this begging human, whimpering on his knees, struck them both as a great tragedy.

Earlier, Aurana and Ana were staring at a single Human face in the mirror: braids to shoulder blades, dark brown eyes, skin that Ana’s mother often said was like sequoias, not just because its shade was a mix between hers and her father’s, but also because these trees were rare, and the last few were isolated in containment for scientific preservation. Apparently they had visited one when she was younger, much younger, but war had devastated most of these. Their trunks remained, and that was why her mother called Ana Sequoia, sometimes, because she believed that, despite struggle, she could remain firmly rooted in herself, her convictions, her family, many of whom she had never met, only holding stories from which she drew threads, senses, sketches.

{ Your mother was not wrong. }

{ Stop reading my mind, } Ana snapped, but knew that she had been, once again, thinking too loudly. 

Ana took off her earrings, the katydids that most people mistook for leaves, the last visible connection of her first home, the last that she had shared with her sister.

“My hair needs to be shorter,” Ana grumbled, knowing this was not possible. She regarded her curls, the way they sagged in the mirror, lamenting how tight they could have been were they not so heavy with length.

Aurana did not care much for hair, only to the extent that it covered her human’s neck: { We’re here for the Human. } a gentle reminder. Thoughts were easily lost in tangled webs. NeVarr had already detailed the report on Friday, which meant that Ana had to catch Aurana up today.

{ Offender on two counts of pro-Nation assaults. Offender of colonial resonance. Offender of Human legally-defined trafficking activities. } Language that was once foreign to Ana had now become everyday words.

{ So it will be easy, then, } Aurana thought. No need to differentiate between Human and Ks’ou. No need to coax the Ks’ou out, as it were. 

{ Not quite. }

It was not difficult infiltrating the hospital. Both the human and the Ks’ou knew already its landscape. Ana’s sister was located in this same building, in another wing, indefinitely, until she recovered or humans decided otherwise. This was the death side of things.

The birth? This was currently happening in one room over of the birthing hall of this place. They need only wait for the human father to take a break, to use the restroom, which he did in the 13 hour ordeal that struck Aurana as both lengthy and, given what the human had to deal with, painfully slow.

Ks’ou do not give birth this way. Ks’ou laid eggs to be inspired, and that was that. The event of a Ks’ou birth was not considered an event; Ks’ou were considered ‘born’ in other ways.

But here it was—a birth, a presumed death, to come. Ana and Aurana had peeked inside the door while everyone was occupied. Before them both: a human woman, with brown hair intertwined with silver, trying to issue life into human hands, on her back while the body screamed and squirmed. Her intent was to give life; the other life-giver, the biological father, was, however, slated to die. He was situated on the other side of the table, playing his part. The lie was in his presence. They knew the one moving the male, charcoal and grey body wasn’t actually the father: they knew it was a Ks’ou, controlling the human, pretending to be engaged in this beautifully horrific orchestra of human blood and other fluids. 

Proper Ks’ou births used to be in etaoin; humans translated this as lagoons but it is not accurate. The Nation, the overarching organization of the Ks’ou species, disrupted this. Soon there was no etaoin. Soon, there was only the call for war, and instead of in etaoin, Ks’ou were born in cold, inorganic ships. 

And then it was his time, to succumb to the biological faculties of the human. And their time to strike. She waited until he was in the hallway, and pulled him, unwillingly into another room. Aurana had dressed her human, Ana’s, body in the warrior clothes of the terrorist group they aspired to join, a gift from a mutual friend.

The human’s eyes widened at the sight of their uniform. “I know you,” he shuddered. This was a lie: he knew nothing about her. He knew of her, but no more. She was a new subject, and attacked him accordingly. In moments that they tumbled she had freed the human, temporarily, from Ks’ou control.

“Choose, human,” Aurana hissed when the blinking, confused human entered the reality that the Ks’ou had denied him. Ana readied her body for their transfer; death came from her, the human, alone.

“I know you can’t answer this,” this father-to-be said, “But how strong are you? The KLF? I just… is freedom close? Would it be worth it, to wait, for my daughter?”

“You’re right,” she said, looking away for fear that her terrible awkwardness for lying would betray information that she couldn’t give. “I can’t answer that. But I can tell you this: don’t look to the KLF for your freedom. It is something humans will secure for yourselves, from your own colonizer.”

“Yeah,” he mumbled, the sobriety of it like a brick struck against his face. He began twitching.

“Your Ks’ou will regain control soon,” she said. “I’m sorry, We need your decision.” 

“I don’t have an answer,” he said, finally, holding up a hand, extending and retracting it as though he were testing to see the very moment that it would return to control of the Ks’ou. “I want to see my baby girl. But I don’t want this monster to lay a finger on her.” He laughed, sadly, as though he had just made a great joke. “My wife has always accused me of being impatient.”

Just then they could hear her very screams through the wall, not quite the blood-curdling scream of a human whose life was about to end; this sounded closer to a great and powerful cry, peaking, apparently, to the crowning finality of a newborn birth.

A Brief History of Human Colonization

It is clear that the Ks’ou alien Colonizers functioned as a disruption to the Human historical timeline. Humans, Earth-wide, would never be the same as before the Ks’ou arrived on Earth, and the nature of Ks’ou control would obliterate and disrupt Human-driven possibility. This has never before been made so clear as the introduction of the terms ‘Pre-Ks’ou Era’ (PKE) and ‘Post-Ks’ou Era’ (PsKE) in many Earth-published textbooks; though these terms are charged and used sparingly here, it should be noted that this work before you is written in 39 PsKE. The small years of the Ks’ou failed attempt at colonization will be simply referred to as ‘KE.’
To be sure, *Humans were colonizers before the arrival of the Ks’ou*. 
Not all Human colonization can be considered the same across all Human contexts.[^2] The title of this work is not to imply that ‘Human’ indicates an essential, singular form of colonization. That ‘Human’ serves as a metonym for ‘all’ or ‘universal’ is an unfortunate implication in some (though not the majority of) Human languages. 
The purpose of this work is to explore the nature of Human-driven colonization across different geographical, political, and cultural contexts on the third planet from Sol (formerly the ambiguously named ‘Sun’) in the Human Solar System within the galaxy that Humans refer to as the Milky Way.  By privileging the era of Human history before the Ks’ou arrival, when time was designated ‘CE’ or ‘AD’ and ‘BCE’ or ‘BC’, the authors aim to provide initial thoughts toward how Human colonization shaped the reaction towards subsequent Ks’ou colonization. Through the lens of the writers, the PKE can never fully be torn apart from the PsKE, though the former was never fully shaped by it, either. Across the galaxy, may we be comforted in the fact that all species share one trait: we are all the artifacts of our histories, whether we remember this history or not…

Their path home was pervaded by the quiet sound of water flickering off leaves. The temperature was dropping, but slowly, so that they trudged over the muddy floor of a forest between seasons. Beads of water still clung to the edges of branches, like unsettled dust. They both felt that it was good to be engulfed by something taller, something bigger than themselves. This had the power to ease a heart likewise engulfed in quiet war. Their shadows, and the dim light through the tops of the trees, had a calming effect. 

It was when they approached the clearing that they saw it—there, on the top of the trees, the slender body, the ridged head and, though an outline of a shadow, a set of horns extending from the back of its head called *naghryoja*. It was aiming a weapon: Aurana could see the glint of the moon on its surface. 

She slipped her own weapon out of her pocket, extended it, and aimed. Not many Thhiyatkhoor graced the Earth these days, enough in number only that this chance encounter did not seem out of place. What was this one doing so high in this tree? Did it not know not to expose itself? Of course. Typical Thhiyatkhoor arrogance. Earth was hardly a threat, though she had heard of Human attempts to kidnap Thhiyatkhoor for money—most by now surely realized that Thhiyatkhoor did not discourse in Human sums, that battle was their currency. If one were to fell a Thhiyatkhoor on accident, adequate payback would involve dealing with their enemies, the greatest of these the Ks’ou, rivals from the beginning. 

But a purposeful kidnapping? Aurana was tempted. She would never give him over to the miserable Nation, but the Ks'ou Liberation Front could use him for their aims to upend and defeat the Ks’ou force currently wreaking its havoc on Humans; Ks’ou anti-Nation liberators wanted an end to the war that had devastated their people, that had destroyed the Universe’s consideration of their species. 

Aurana aimed, but the glint of the object the Thhiyatkhoor held caught her eye. Was it really a weapon? Through the pistonet’s viewer she adjust for a closer look. The object that she imagined was a weapon seemed round and clear, except for inside. There, they saw a swirling sphere, deep blue and green and brown as lush planets are, and there were clouds as well as light streaks, a shining lace of phosphoric luminescence, that cut through the bodies of terra.

Unlike Earth, this planet’s landmass was largely connected in a band that clustered toward the center, a band that humans would refer to as an ‘equator’. Many peninsulas speckled the large bodies of water north and south of this center, but they were hardly visible in this opthastre. 

It didn’t matter. There it was, entirely.

*kyôsta!*

She imagined that she had thought this, but as her ears trembled, she realized that this Thhiyatkhoor was saying it also, over and over again; his narrow, sharp lips moved in the dark. She shifted the viewer towards his head instead, to discern his expression, and to see his mouth, if it were true what she was too far away to hear.

 Her finger slipped.

She could see the shot, though tiny, tearing the air apart. 

Aurana stood her human’s body in frozen horror. She had never unintentionally triggered her weapon before—was always precise, until now. 
 
{ Don’t worry. I got you. } Ana whispered her assurance. Aurana dared to look upwards and understood: Ana had sensed the mistake she was about to make, shifted her physical hands so the shot missed him by moments. The Thhiyatkhoor was, thankfully, unscathed, but he was now looking directly towards them. 

When they looked through the viewfinder again, the Thhiyatkhoor was gone. She could see the movement of the trees but could not hear its rustling, could barely hear the deftness as he tore, quietly, through the branches at an impossibly quick speed. Anxiety gripped her; she did not fear, was accustomed to battle, but she did not have enough information to discern how she should prepare for what would occur next. She knew that running would be foolish—Thhiyatkhoor were excellent tree-runners—but to remain would risk a provocative wrath. She could only stand still to see what kind of Thhiyatkhoor this one was. The leaves that rustled sounded as the wind; she could not discern where, exactly it was, until a sudden shake just in front of her. 

The creature swung down in a simultaneous stomp of both its legs, only minute spaces in front of her. Thhiyatkhoor are not particularly beautiful creatures: with slim, angular bodies and little shapeliness except for the sharp of their arm blades, there was not much to them except outline. Aurana concluded that they were like muscular seaweed— perhaps *dangerous* muscular seaweed. Ana of course disagreed: she liked the Thhiyatkhoor crown, as she called it, but these, even round, were only an extension of Thhiyatkhoor, and not the Thhiyatkhoor itself. Humans at least had a little roundness that made sense. Yet being Ks’ou and thus born without sight, it ultimately didn’t matter: who was she to judge what was pretty and what wasn’t?

He brought forward his three formidable arm blades; struck against her small weapon she now used as a tiny shield. She swung her other arm and missed, purposefully, to show him a rhythm he did not understand, causing enough confusion for her to deal a blow to his jaw. He was unfazed; her human’s hand throbbed. As they clashed again, he leaned in close as though to intimidate her. His blades could fell thick branches, and her weapon, though long enough to act as a thin shield, was beginning to give. He was obviously *warrior class*, notably in the interim pauses of this initial scuffle, the ways his eyes shifted over the body of her human, assessing speed and estimating their next movements. 

She knew, also, that this attack was restrained, so it was no surprise when the caveat came, his eyes shining night against night. “You attempt an attack?”

He spoke low. Thhiyatkhoor voices tended to be tonic; their throats and palates are curved differently than humans, so it made it notoriously difficult for humans to understand what Thhiyatkhoor found important, and lead to many different misunderstandings between the history of their races. No misunderstanding as deep as between Ks’ou and Thhiyatkhoor, though. The sound that Aurana was so used to—a sound had become normal to her, like rushing water, a high-pitched hum, that had nestled itself into the creases of her mind, suddenly diminished, like a wave breaking suddenly to become calm. The voice of this Thhiyatkhoor cut through it like the bow of a ship through saltwater. It was the first thing she noticed about him. But she couldn’t stay with this thought long enough to make it salient, and so quickly forgot it.

“Yy- You’re a Thhiyatkhoor.” She could try to feign ignorance. So said the stupidest thing that came to mind. His response did not disappoint. 

*“Obviously.”* His slate flared superiority. A brief shine over a slower diffused cloudburst, like grey and white wisps passing aside a full moon. Ana had only seen Thhiyatkhoor in books, so Aurana took her awe at his skin emotions and expressed it as her own. 

“What are you doing on Earth?”

“What are you doing with that weapon?” 

“Nothing,” she said, exaggerating her human’s embarrassment. She held up both arms, the weapon dangling from the thumb of one, wondering how many details of her face he could see in the light wind. “A misfire. I’m sorry. I’ve never seen a *live* Thhiyatkhoor before.” 

For her this was a lie, and she was still learning how to do these, but what did a Thhiyatkhoor know of good or bad lying in a Human context? He hesitated, regarded her with his dark eyes. The sphere—humans referred to it as an opthastre and she couldn’t remember the word in Endaithsu—glowed in his hand.

“Can I see it?” she asked honestly. “The thing, you have—the marble. I will lay my weapon down; honest, I only was using it as a telescope to see what you were holding in the moonlight, and I did not know the trigger was activated.”

As a “Human,” she placed her weapon on the ground timidly. Aurana was invoking every aspect of Ana, the early Ana, the pre-war child, *the unborn*, that she could. 

“We are in a time of peace,” she said. Earth’s unprecedented peace—even for Earth—was propaganda, of course, begun by humans themselves and now perpetuated by Settlers. But at 39 PsKE, human memory waned, and now that more of the universe was open to them, so, too, the whelm of distraction. 

“Excessive peace,” the Thhiyatkhoor mumbled. He glanced at the *opthastre*. “It is civilian grade.” Reluctantly, he placed it into her hands, while staring directly at her grounded weapon as he did. The opthastre, close to 3 inches in diameter, contained within it the real-time projection of an image that she thought she’d never see in her lifetime.

“This is my place of origin, my *kyôsta*,” he said as she held up the swirling planet to her eyes. He glanced towards her ear and neck, but it was useless: though she did not sport the *zilaa*[^3] sign, she wore a scarf that covered her neck and the edge of her ear, and was still firmly wrapped there despite the intensity of this initial battle. “Kyôsta being the word for ‘home’ in my native language.”

“I figured that.” Her tone was coarse, but she looked at this creature, this tall, slate, Thhiyatkhoor, the shadows of his adolescent *naghryoja* cutting against the stars in the backdrop. Gauged him. “Do you miss it?”

“My Human hosts have been as family to me since before I formed branches. But when I see what my planet looks like from the outside, perhaps that thing you call ‘missing’ is what I experience.”

She twitched, annoyed. It is not *your* planet, she wanted to sneer. Not alone. But Thhiyatkhoor speak this way, of course, because they have succeeded in making, marking, and manifesting their planet as their own. He was between child and adulthood, likely similar to her own interplanetary measure of passing. She pushed aside these political thoughts and regarded the sphere, which held an image she had hardly seen; Ks’ou were not allowed to think of this *kyôsta* as *kyôsta-sy*, though it framed their indigeneity. 

It had been years since she had even seen her own planet of her birth, but this was different: she had never seen projections of the original *kyôsta* such as this. Spheres of this kind were not technology bestowed to her species. 

She held it back out to him, with some resistance, “Thank you. Your so-called *kyôsta* is a beautiful place. Perhaps Humans can visit one day.” This laughable proposition was something Ana was thinking, loudly, and therefore a real text that Humans might speak.

“Perhaps.” He made a rude sound, one that Aurana likened to scoffing; wordlessly, he took the sphere back. What more did he want? Argument? Understanding? *Meaning?* But he seemed stalled. She picked up her weapon again and stuffed it into her pocket to begin heading out of the forest starred.
